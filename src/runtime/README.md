# Fahrenheit Runtime Library
This library is home to the parts of Fahrenheit which must be initialized at runtime.

It is an essential part of Fahrenheit, inseparable from the Core Library, and provides the implementation for certain APIs the Core Library exposes.

Do not link against this library. It has no public API surface, and you may not rely on any of its implementation details. You should link with the Core Library instead.
