# Fahrenheit Runtime Library
This library is home to the parts of Fahrenheit which must be initialized at runtime.

It is an essential part of Fahrenheit, inseparable from the Core Library, and implements certain APIs the Core Library exposes.

Do not link against this library. It has no public API surface, and you must not rely on any implementation detail.

You should link with the Core Library instead.
