 * Many primitive IDs and enumerations in this game are given merely as `#define`s. What the true underlying type is is unknown.
 *
 * Fahrenheit introduces strongly typed constants for all such IDs and enumerations. Because I have to guess the underlying type,
 * odds are I got it wrong. For this reason I introduce type aliases for each; this way you can change the underlying datatype
 * of any primitive declaration here, in one spot. You should follow this approach when adding new constants.
